This Project takes in a photo with any of the following extension, {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp', '.tiff', '.webp', '.heic'}.
The class converts the extension to a .jpg file. Then the image is uploaded to imgur and the link to the image is returned.
The link of the image is then displayed.

This Project is so I can use a photo with any type of file extension and use it for my fantasy football profile picture.

I used flask to run the webpage with the functions ran in python.
